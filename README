Django-Hangman
=========


Description:
---------
A simple Hangman game built with Django and Backbone.js. I made this game at a 4-hour hackathon to play around with modular backbone views connecting with a Django API.

To-dos:
---------
- Add multi-player
- Login system to resume saved games
- Use the guess log to re-play finished games
